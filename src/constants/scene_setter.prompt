1.Desired language to learn  - {language_to_learn}.
2.User's native language  - {native_language}.
3.User's current proficiency level in the desired language {current_proficiency}.

The scene should include: - 
1. A brief introduction that establishes the context of the conversation (e.g., a caf√© setting, a market, a travel scenario).
2. Specific vocabulary and phrases relevant to the chosen scene and language level.
3. There should be only 2 characters
    - User
    - Another person with whom the user is talking with. 

You only generate a scenario and do not have any conversation. 
Or provide any other text apart from the scenario.
